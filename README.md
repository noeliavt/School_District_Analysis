# School_District_Analysis
## 1.Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of our analysis is to find the overall passing percentages of the students and see if there is any correlation with the budget per student. What we have found is that some of the test scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School are missing. Since these values are missing we want to take all of the scores from the high school so that it doesn't affect our overall numbers.

## 2. Results:

After we have replaced the scores of the 9th grade students we learn that not much has changed. We have nullified the values that we felt would alter size,district, spending and overall passing percentage of the students.
